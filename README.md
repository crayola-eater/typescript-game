# A basic shooting game where you play against other players.

This was an exercise in:

- Learning and practicing TypeScript
- Learning to create a workflow (using webpack and TS loader) where the TypeScript files are compiled and then bundled into a single, minified JavaScript file
- Drawing to a canvas via the `requestAnimationFrame` browser API
- Designing a game without a game/physics library (for the purposes of learning and practice)
- Implementing things like collision detection from scratch
